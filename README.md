# Exoplanet Detection via Machine Learning on Kepler Light Curves

A machine learning pipeline for detecting and classifying exoplanet transits from Kepler space telescope photometry data. Built as a collaborative project between a CS Lead (pipeline, ML) and a Physics Lead (astrophysical validation, feature design).

---

## What This Does

This project takes raw Kepler light curve data from a confirmed exoplanet host star (KIC 11446443 / TrES-2b) and runs it through a full ML-ready preprocessing pipeline. The goal is to detect transit signals — the tiny dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its host star — using a combination of signal processing and supervised machine learning.

The pipeline goes from raw FITS files all the way to a windowed, physics-validated dataset ready for model training.

## Pipeline

### Phase 1 — Data Ingestion (`ingest.py`)

Downloads Kepler long-cadence (30-min) light curves from MAST via `lightkurve`. Extracts stellar parameters from FITS headers: Teff, log g, stellar radius, metallicity, Kepler magnitude.

### Phase 2 — Preprocessing (`preprocess.py`)

Physics-approved pipeline order:

```
stitch → flatten → normalize → clip upward outliers
→ extract numpy → interpolate small gaps → window → save
```

Key decisions and the physics behind them:

**Stitching**: Each quarter is normalized individually before stitching via `corrector_func=lambda x: x.normalize()` to remove quarter-to-quarter flux offsets.

**Flattening**: Uses `lightkurve`'s built-in `flatten(window_length=1001)`. Window length of 1001 cadences (~20 days) is long enough that the Savitzky-Golay filter cannot fit through TrES-2b's 1.7-hour transit. Rule of thumb: window must be ≥ 10× transit duration in cadences.

**Normalization**: `lc_flat.normalize()` via lightkurve only. No manual median divide afterward — double normalization washes out the ~0.016 transit signal entirely.

**Outlier clipping**: Upward outliers only (cosmic rays, flares, momentum dumps). Downward dips are never clipped — a planet can only block light, never add it. Transit dips are always negative excursions.

**Gap handling**: Linear interpolation for gaps ≤ 10 consecutive cadences. Gaps > 10 cadences are masked as NaN. Known large gaps (BKJD 808–902, 1280–1322, 1413) correspond to Q8 absence, January 2013 safe mode event, and reaction wheel degradation near end of mission — all verified and safe to mask.

**Windowing**: 201-cadence windows (~100 hours) with 50-cadence stride. Two output arrays:
- `windows_raw.npy` — fractional flux values preserved for feature extraction
- `windows_ml.npy` — per-window normalized for ML model input

Remaining NaNs inside valid windows are filled with the window median, not zero. Zeroing creates fake flat-bottomed dips that look like shallow transits to the ML model.

**Final output stats:**
- 1,031 windows of shape (1031, 201)
- Flux range: 0.9856 to 1.0026
- Transit depth recovered: 0.0144 (1.44%)

### Phase 3 — Feature Engineering + ML Classification (`features.py`, `model.py`)

Random Forest classifier on 3 physics features across 8 Kepler targets (1,182 samples).

**Features used:**
- `norm_depth` — normalized transit depth (flux_out - flux_in) / flux_out
- `dur_period_ratio` — transit duration as fraction of orbital period
- `radius_ratio` — planet-to-star radius ratio (sqrt of norm_depth)

**Operating parameters (physics-approved):**
- Threshold: 0.10
- Precision: 0.855 (1 in 8 candidates is a false positive)
- Recall: 0.589 (catches ~59% of real transits)
- CV ROC-AUC: 0.974 ± 0.012 (strong generalization across all folds)

**Honest limitations:**
- Recall ceiling attributed to feature space depth — 3 features derived from the same flux_in/flux_out measurements hit a generalization limit on diverse targets
- Identified improvement path: ingress/egress slope + secondary eclipse depth (Phase 5)

**Why CV AUC matters more than test recall:**
The 0.974 CV score confirms the model has genuinely learned the physics of transit vs EB distinction. Test recall instability is a small dataset artifact — 130 test samples is too few for stable recall estimates on a diverse multi-target problem.
